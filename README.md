This is my personal website, and also a project in its own right. I’ve been building and iterating on it over the past year, gradually improving both the design and functionality.

The site takes heavy inspiration from the Windows 95 UI. Each tab behaves like a classic desktop “window”, meaning it can be dragged around, closed, and multiple windows can be open at the same time.

Built with React and TypeScript.
