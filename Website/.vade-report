# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for this React + Vite project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package (v1.6.1) to dependencies
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json

### 2. Analytics Component Integration
Modified `src/App.tsx`:
- Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'`
- Added `<Analytics />` component inside the Router component at the end of the App component
- This ensures analytics tracking works across all routes

## Implementation Details

The Analytics component was added following the Vercel documentation for React applications:
- The component is placed within the Router to ensure it tracks all route changes
- It's positioned at the end of the Router component to avoid interfering with existing functionality
- The Analytics component automatically tracks page views and provides seamless integration with React Router

## Verification

1. ✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
2. ✅ No new linting errors introduced (pre-existing errors in other files remain unchanged)
3. ✅ Analytics component properly imported and integrated

## Next Steps

After deployment to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Analytics tab → Enable)
2. Deploy the application using `vercel deploy` or via Git integration
3. Verify analytics are working by checking for `/_vercel/insights/view` requests in browser Network tab
4. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab
